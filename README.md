## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/)

### What I learned

In addition to delving into the BEM methodology, I also learned how to apply an image with some overlapping colors.

```css
.card__image {
    background: url("../../images/image-header-desktop.jpg") center/cover
      no-repeat var(--soft-violet);

    grid-column: 2/2;
    grid-row: 1/1;
    border-radius: 0 10px 10px 0;
  }
```

### Continued development

Maybe by CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Documentation BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - This helped me a little with the functioning of the BEM methodology.
- [A Complete Guide to Grid ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an article that can be useful to get a better understanding of the display grid and how to use it.
- [CSS Basics: Using Multiple Backgrounds ](https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-using-multiple-backgrounds/) - This is an article that helped me understand and apply multiple backgrounds. I would recommend it to anyone who is still learning this concept.
